# Personal Portfolio Page
First attempt at portfolio for bootcamp hw

Notes:
I chose to set fix the header instead of the footer because to me it seemed more important to have the navigation options available at any point. I also preferred the look of only seeing the footer once you've reached the bottom of the page.

Alper suggested to use a background color for the "container main-container" section so as to set the text out from the page. I tried this with a few different colors and found that I preferred the text to lie directly on the background image itself. Just a personal preference, I hope it doesn't count against my grade :D
